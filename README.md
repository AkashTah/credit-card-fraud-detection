# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on customer data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, old and new balance, and a target column indicating fraudulent activity (`isFraud`).

## 🚀 Approach
- Preprocessing (label encoding, feature scaling, handling missing data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn visualizations)
- Model Training (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: EDA and model training notebooks
- `src/`: Modular scripts for preprocessing and training
- `data/`: Dataset files (e.g., `creditcard.csv`)
