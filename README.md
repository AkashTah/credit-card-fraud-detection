# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using numpy, scikit learn, and a few other Python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

## 🚀 Approach
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our dataset
2. Apply different Machine Learning algorithms to our dataset
3. Train and Evaluate our models on the dataset and pick the best one.
